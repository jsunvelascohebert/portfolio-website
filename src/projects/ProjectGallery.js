          <p>In order to bridge the gap in knowledge between medical information and day-to-day awareness, Medipin was created as a proof-of-concept, pin-and-note web application. With Medipin, users can create an account, search and save medical articles from an external API, organize articles based on customized topics, and add personalized notes to each article. This project was solo-coded by me; moreover, enhancements of the site will continue to come out when time permits.</p>

          <p>Grounded by Linda Tuhiwai Smithâ€™s definition of struggle (2012), this body of work evaluates the role of visual, verbal, and visceral storytelling in engaging the imagination as a language of possibility outside that of colonialism. It begs the question: how might we decolonize our minds, bodies, hearts, and spirits by (re-)engaging with and (re-)embodying the stories that we are involved within?</p>

          <p>As part of the curriculum for receiving the Certificate in Collegiate Teaching in Art & Design, a teaching portfolio was required. Inside can be found my teaching philosophy, inclusivity statement, and examples of proposed and accepted syllabi.

The name is a mashup of the words "family" and "animals" which alludes to its themes of showcasing dynamic relationships through these objects, previously subjects.</p>
